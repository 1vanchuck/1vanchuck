# Hi, I'm Ivan Antonov üëã

## iOS Developer | SwiftUI & UIKit

I'm a passionate and results-driven **iOS Developer** with over a year of hands-on experience building beautiful, scalable, and modern mobile applications from concept to App Store.

My unique background, combining a **Master's in Computer Science** with a **Bachelor's in Engineering**, provides me with a deep understanding of software architecture, data structures, and low-level principles. My professional IT experience in **Canada, the UK, and Ukraine** has equipped me with a global perspective and excellent communication skills.

I thrive on clean code, robust architecture, and creating intuitive user experiences. I'm currently seeking a full-time iOS Developer role where I can contribute to exciting projects and continue to grow.
